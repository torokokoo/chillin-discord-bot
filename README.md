# Chillin Bot for Discord

This is a really simple bot made for Chillin Server, it's not automatized and nothing like that, it just works and thats what matter.
It's more like a personal project but I uploaded it anyways, feel free to check the code and see if you can use any of it.

## Bot Functions
- Help command
- Admin command (shows all admins, not dynamic)
- Ticket command (creates a role that can access to ticket channel and get help from admins)
- Clear command (clear messages from the channel)
- Author command (Who doesn't like some ego)

### How tickets work
It's really easy and not automatized at all, it just gives a "ticket" role to the user that ran the command, with this role you can access to a #ticket channel that is only visible for him (ticket role) and admins.
Once the problem is solved you must remove the ticket role so he can't access again.
